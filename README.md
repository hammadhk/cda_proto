This app would have a couple of pages only
(1) Complaint filing form (list params of this form)
	i - Shumar Number
	ii - Naam
	iii - Phone
	iv - House
	v - Street
	vi - Sector
	vii - Time
	viii - Shikayat
(2) Complain view (readonly) without any access restrictions
(3) A tabular list which shows basic complain information and an action list to update the complaint status.
(4) A login screen would provide a restricted access to (2) and (3)
(5) [Optional] A search for to find complaints based on various criteria

I would work with Hammad to ensure that the UI is presentable and that our initial scope is covered.
This app would only be used for demo. It would not be handed over to CDA.
